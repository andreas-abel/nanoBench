Each count represents 8 computation operations, one for each element.  Applies to SSE* and AVX* packed single precision floating-point instructions: ADD SUB HADD HSUB SUBADD MUL DIV MIN MAX SQRT RSQRT RCP DPP FM(N)ADD/SUB.  DPP and FM(N)ADD/SUB instructions count twice as they perform 2 calculations per element.
